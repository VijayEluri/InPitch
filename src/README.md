README for InPitch version 0.5.3
================================

Nov. 25, 2016

It's been a very long time since an update, but thanks to a user report about
virus scanner issues, we have made a few updates.

  1) New MIDI instruments which sound much, much better than the old ones,
     thanks to the "Nice Keys" sound font.

  2) Resize the window to properly include the "level" menu on OS X

  3) Previously SourceForge and some other virus scanners were reporting malware
     detected in 0.5.1, I believe in the Windows executable. I don't know if it
     was a false positive, but we are now just distributing a .jar file. If Java
     is properly installed, you should be able to just run the .jar file
     directly, either by double-clicking or by running from the command line
     (java -jar InPitch-0.5.3.jar).


Hope you enjoy ...
