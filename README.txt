Release date: June 05, 2006


** Requirements **

To get started, you will need two things:


(1) A Java virtual machine installed on your system. If you don't already have one installed,
    or don't know, get one from Sun Microsystems at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp.
    Download "JRE 5.0 Update 7" or any later version and install it. (InPitch has only been tested
    with Sun's JVM.)


(2) The file soundbank-deluxe.gm, also available from Sun, at

    http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/soundbanks.html#download

    Here you will want to download the "deluxe" version. (NOTE: at present this site isn't
    displayed correctly in Firefox -- you will need to either use Internet Explorer to download
    it or the URL below.)

    The file can alternatively be downloaded directly via the following URL:

    http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/soundbank-deluxe.gm.zip


    This file should extracted and the soundbank-delux.gm file should be placed in the
    directory where InPitch is extracted (whichever directory the file InPitch.exe is in; 
    usually the directory will be called "InPitch 0.5" or similar).



** Installation **

(1) Extract the InPitch.zip file to any directory of your choice (e.g. C:\Program Files\)

(2) Make sure you've installed Sun's JRE (we have not tested with any other JVM) (see URL
    above)

(3) Place the soundbank-deluxe.gm file (instructions to download above) in the InPitch
    directory.


You can then run the program by executing (i.e. double-clicking) the file InPitch.exe. If the
program does not run, you likely either do not have the soundbank-deluxe.gm file in the right
place or do not have Sun's JRE properly installed.



** Instruction for Use **

The program once up and running should be straightforward to use. Click "Play" to have the
program play one of the currently selected notes, and then identify which one you think it is
by clicking the corresponding button (C#, A, etc.). After you demonstrate proficiency with the
first two notes, the program will add a third; and after you demonstrate proficiency in
identifying those three, it will add a fourth; etc. While initially it may be easy to get by
using only relative pitch, this will get difficult as more notes are added. The idea is not to
try to identify the notes using relative pitch; rather, try to listen closely (but in a relaxed
manner) to the character of each individual note and use that to identify it.

You can change which notes are being used by selecting the level from the drop-down menu if
you want to skip ahead or you feel the program is advancing too slowly. You can also change
the order in which notes are presented by using the "Note Order" menu at the top. (At present
there are only three different orderings).

There are a number of different instruments available to choose from under the "Sound"->"Midi"
menu, many of which are rather interesting.

This program will likely not be the only thing you need to develop an ability to recognize notes.
However you may find it to be a useful tool for practice; it is only through regular practice and
attention that can you develop new skills, as you will undoubedly know from your endeavors in
music.



We hope you find this program useful. If you have any problems, questions, comments or bug
reports, you can contact the authors at:
